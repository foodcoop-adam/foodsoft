FoodsoftMultishared
===================

Allows multiple foodcoops to participate in each other's orders when sharing a
single database. Uses the multicoops functionality.

Foodcoop options in `config/app_config.yml`:
```yaml
  # Set this to true to hide the foodcoop from foodcoop lists, like the
  # central signup list introduced by the multishared plugin.
  #hidden: true

  # When showing this foodcoop in a list of foodcoops, this is added
  # as a short description. Empty by default.
  #list_desc: for yuppies and greenies, every last Friday of the month

  # Introduction text on group selection signup page.
  #multishared_signup_text: "Select which foodcoop you'd like to join:"
```
